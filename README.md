# London-Tube-Stations

Exploring and visualizing London Tube Stations using NetworkX Graphs

## Description

Finding Shortest path between any two stations using the following Algorithms:

1. Depth First Search (& reverse implementation)
2. Breath First Search (& reverse implementation)
3. Uniform Cost Search
4. UCS with +5 for line change
5. UCS with +1 for station change
6. UCS with using Zones as heuristics
7. UCS with added edges in the Graph for different lines
